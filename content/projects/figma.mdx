## Project Overview

This project explores a **UI/UX concept for a social VR platform**, where the challenge was to design **navigation systems and spatial menus** that are intuitive, immersive, and accessible without breaking user flow.  

The prototype was designed entirely in **Figma**, focusing on spatial interactions and menu flows that respect the 3D immersive environment.  

## Key Features

- **Immersive Navigation**: Spatial menus designed to feel natural inside VR environments.  
- **User-Centered Flow**: Focused on reducing cognitive load while moving through virtual spaces.  
- **Consistency Across Contexts**: Menus adapt to different VR scenarios without disrupting immersion.  
- **Prototype in Figma**: Visualized interactions and flows with clickable prototypes.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For prototyping, interaction flow, and design visualization.  
- **UX/UI Principles**: For ensuring accessibility and intuitive interaction in VR contexts.  
- **Prototyping**: To simulate user flows before real implementation.  

## Design Process

The design process started with **researching VR interaction patterns** and analyzing how users currently interact with spatial menus.  

Emphasis was placed on:  

- Clear visual hierarchy within spatial menus.  
- Reducing disorientation by keeping navigation consistent.  

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Immersion vs Usability**: Ensured menus were easy to access without breaking immersion by using natural placements and minimalistic UI.  
- **Accessibility in 3D Space**: Designed scalable, high-contrast elements. 
- **Flow Validation**: Used Figma’s prototyping features to test navigation before development.
