## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Self Driving Car Neural Network** project!  
This project explores the exciting world of artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles by using a **neural network with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** to train cars to drive themselves inside a simulated environment.

The simulation is powered by **Python and Pygame**, where virtual cars learn to avoid obstacles and navigate a track using evolutionary algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network with NEAT:** Cars evolve their driving strategies over generations.  
- **Simulation Environment:** Built with Pygame for visual testing and validation.  
- **Adaptive Learning:** Each car improves by evolving weights and structures of neural networks.  
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy to extend with different track layouts or more complex behaviors.  

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.  
- **NEAT-Python:** For evolving neural networks.  
- **NumPy:** Efficient numerical computations.  
- **Pygame:** For building the simulation environment.  
- **SciPy:** For additional scientific computing utilities.
