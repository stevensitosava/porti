## Project Overview

**Web Scraping for Amazon Products** is a Python project focused on extracting product information such as **title, price, rating, review count, and availability**.  

The project leverages **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** to automate the collection of structured data from Amazon product pages. Extracted data can then be processed with **Pandas** and **NumPy** for deeper analysis, reporting, or integration into larger systems.  

This tool is ideal for researchers, e-commerce analysts, or developers who need to automate the collection of real-time product information.
