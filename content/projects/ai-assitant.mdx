## Project Overview

**AI Assistant for Football Betting** is an automated system designed to provide data-driven predictions and insights for the 5 major European football leagues.  

Using statistical models trained on thousands of historical results, the system predicts outcomes, goal markets, and identifies potential value bets. Beyond predictions, it suggests stake sizes using the **Kelly Criterion** and continuously tracks performance through financial and accuracy backtests.  

The entire workflow is automated via **n8n**, which executes the analysis, summarizes results with AI, and delivers updates directly to a **Telegram group**.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Betting always involves risk — use responsibly.

## Key Features

- **Automated Analysis**: Match data processed and analyzed without manual intervention  
- **Statistical Models**: Predictions based on large datasets of historical results  
- **Value Detection**: Identifies bets with positive expected value  
- **Kelly Criterion**: Calculates optimal stake sizes for bankroll management  
- **Performance Tracking**: Backtests both financial outcomes and prediction accuracy  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automated results delivered via Telegram  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and modeling  
- **Pandas & SciPy**: Statistical modeling and data analysis  
- **n8n**: Orchestrating and automating the workflow  
- **Docker**: For consistent deployment and scalability  

---

## Process & Automation Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Match results and stats gathered from trusted sources  
2. **Statistical Modeling**: Predictions generated with regression and probability models  
3. **Value Bet Identification**: Markets scanned for opportunities based on odds and models  
4. **Stake Calculation**: Kelly Criterion applied for bankroll optimization  
5. **Automation via n8n**: Runs tasks, generates summaries, and connects to AI  
6. **Delivery**: Predictions and analysis pushed directly to Telegram subscribers  

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Reliability**: Implemented cleaning and validation routines to ensure accuracy  
- **Complex Probability Models**: Balanced model performance with interpretability  
- **Automation Failures**: Built retry logic and Dockerized the pipeline for stability  
- **User Access**: Dashboard remains private 🔒, but predictions are shared on Telegram 📲
